# python-soundboard
This is a soundboard that has been coded using python alongside the pygame and tkinter library.


# Setup
We make use of a virtual audio cable which is where the audio from the soundboard gets routed to. The one we used for this project can be found via the following link - https://vb-audio.com/Cable

Follow the steps for the installer and reboot once you're done.

Pipe your microphone through the virtual cable by going to sound control panel, then recording then properties - via right clicking on your microphone - and ticking "listen to this device" and setting the "playback through device" option as "CABLE input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)".

When you're in a call in discord for example, set your microphone to "CABLE input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)".

(If others can't hear the soundboard audio, you may need to tinker around with discord's microphone settings such as changing the input profile to "studio".)

# Potential improvements
1. Adding shortcuts so that certain keyboard shortcuts can trigger the soundboard to start playing audio
2. Making it so that the users are able to hear the audio that has been triggered without any negative effects such as echoes
3. Adding more buttons/ allowing users to add as many buttons as they wish
