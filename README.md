# python-soundboard
This is a soundboard that has been coded using python alongside the pygame and tkinter library.


# Setup
We make use of a virtual audio cable which is where the audio from the soundboard gets routed to. The one we used for this project can be found via the following link - https://vb-audio.com/Cable
Follow the steps for the installer and reboot once you're done.
Pipe your microphone through the virtual cable by going to sound control panel, then recording then properties - via right clicking on your microphone - and ticking "listen to this device" and setting the "playback through device" option as "CABLE input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)".
When you're in a call in discord for example, set your microphone to "CABLE input (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)".
(If others can't hear the soundboard audio, you may need to tinker around with discord's microphone settings such as changing the input profile to "studio".)
